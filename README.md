## 👋 Who am I?

I’m an **Applied AI Engineer** with **6+ years of experience** building **end-to-end machine learning systems**—from research prototypes to production-grade deployments.

My work sits at the **intersection of AI, geospatial data, and performance-critical systems**:
- Deep learning for **remote sensing & SAR imagery**
- **Raster / satellite data pipelines** at scale
- **LLMs & RAG systems** for real-world automation
- **Edge AI & hardware-aware deployment** (AMD Versal, C++ inference)

I care deeply about:
- 📦 **Reproducibility**
- ⚙️ **Systems design**
- 🚀 **Deployability, not just papers**
- 📉 **Latency, memory, and real constraints**
